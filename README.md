Aim: Introduction To Python

Theory:
Data Types
Python is dynamically typed, automatically assigning types based on value:
Integer (int): Whole numbers.
Float (float): Decimal numbers.
String (str): Text characters.
Boolean (bool): Logical True/False.
Math Package
The math module provides advanced mathematical tools:
Constants: Accesses high-precision values like math.pi.
Functions: Includes math.log10() for logarithms and math.sin() for trigonometry.
Note: Trigonometric inputs must be in radians

Algorithm:
calculator:
Start.
Prompt the user to enter a value for a and convert it to an integer.
Prompt the user to enter a value for b and convert it to an integer.
Calculate addition(a+b), subtraction(a-b), multiplication(a*b), division(a/b), and exponentiation(a**b).
Print the formatted results.
Stop.

comparision of two numbers:
Start.
Prompt the user to enter a value for a and convert it to an integer.
Prompt the user to enter a value for b and convert it to an integer.
If a is greater than b:
Print "a is greater than b".
Elif:
Print "b is greater than a".
else:
Print "a and b are equal"
Stop.

area of circle:
Start.
Import the math module.
Prompt the user to enter the radius r and convert it to a float.
Calculate the area using the formula: Area = pi*r*r (using math.pi).
Print the calculated area.
Stop.

Conclusion: 
This program shows how to take user input, perform arithmetic operations, and use the math package for geometry. It also demonstrates how conditional statements (if-else) allow the program to compare values and give a specific output based on the result.
