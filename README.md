# Experiment 1
# Aim: Introduction To Python

## Theory:
Data Types
Python is dynamically typed, automatically assigning types based on value:
Integer (int): Whole numbers.
Float (float): Decimal numbers.
String (str): Text characters.
Boolean (bool): Logical True/False.
Math Package
The math module provides advanced mathematical tools:
Constants: Accesses high-precision values like math.pi.
Functions: Includes math.log10() for logarithms and math.sin() for trigonometry.
Note: Trigonometric inputs must be in radians

## Algorithm:
    calculator:
    1)Start.
    2)Prompt the user to enter a value for a and convert it to an integer.
    3)Prompt the user to enter a value for b and convert it to an integer.
    4)Calculate addition(a+b), subtraction(a-b), multiplication(a*b), division(a/b), and exponentiation(a**b).
    5)Print the formatted results.
    6)Stop.

    comparision of two numbers:
    1)Start.
    2)Prompt the user to enter a value for a and convert it to an integer.
    3)Prompt the user to enter a value for b and convert it to an integer.
    4)If a is greater than b:
     Print "a is greater than b".
     Elif:
     Print "b is greater than a".
     else:
     Print "a and b are equal"
    5)Stop.

    area of circle:
    1)Start.
    2)Import the math module.
    3)Prompt the user to enter the radius r and convert it to a float.
    4)Calculate the area using the formula: Area = pi*r*r (using math.pi).
    5)Print the calculated area.
    6)Stop.

## Conclusion: 
This program shows how to take user input, perform arithmetic operations, and use the math package for geometry. It also demonstrates how conditional statements (if-else) allow the program to compare values and give a specific output based on the result.
